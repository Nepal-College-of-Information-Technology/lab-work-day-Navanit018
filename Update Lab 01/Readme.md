1. Title : Introduction to Multimedia Systems and Familiarization with GitHub & Discord.

2. Objective
- To understand the concept and components of multimedia systems.
- To gain hands-on experience with GitHub basics for version control and collaboration.
- To explore Discord as a communication platform for technical teamwork.

3. Theory / Background 
- A multimedia system integrates text, audio, video, graphics, and animation into a single interactive environment.
- Key features include integration, interactivity, real-time performance, compression, and synchronization.
- GitHub provides a distributed version control system enabling repository management, branching, and collaborative coding.
- Discord supports real-time communication, file sharing, and community building, making it a valuable tool for project collaboration.

4. Apparatus 
- Hardware: PC with multimedia-capable CPU/GPU, microphone, speakers.
- Software: GitHub Desktop / Git CLI, Discord application, multimedia presentation tools.
- Network: Internet connection for GitHub and Discord access.

5. Procedure
- Multimedia System Exploration
- Studied multimedia components (input, processing, storage, output, networking).
- Created a sample multimedia presentation combining text, audio, and video.
- GitHub Familiarization
- Created a repository.
- Practiced committing changes, branching, and merging.
- Explored collaboration features (issues, pull requests).
- Discord Familiarization
- Joined a lab server.
- Used channels for discussions and file sharing.
- Tested voice/video communication features.

6.  Observations
   
- Multimedia systems require synchronization between audio and video for smooth playback.
- GitHub simplifies collaborative coding and ensures version control.
- Discord enhances team communication and reduces coordination overhead.

7. Results
- Successfully created and tested a basic multimedia presentation.
- Gained practical knowledge of GitHub workflows.
- Learned to use Discord for technical collaboration.

8. Conclusion
The lab provided a foundational understanding of multimedia systems and introduced essential collaboration tools. By combining technical exploration (GitHub) with communication practice (Discord), students are better prepared for team-based software development and multimedia projects.
