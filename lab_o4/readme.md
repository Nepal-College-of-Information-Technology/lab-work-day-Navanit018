## Title: Fundamentals of Digital Images and Basic Image Operations using python.


## Objectives:


==> The main objectives of this experiment are as follows:

To load and display digital images using python.

To understand the concept and structure of digital images.

To convert color images into grayscale and binary images.

To perform basic image transformations such as resizing and flipping.

To crop a specific Region of Interest (ROI) from an image

## Background Theory:

-Digital image representattion.

-use precisely.

-color models.


-Image file format

-Basic image transformation

-introduction to opencv

  ##  Procedure
  

-First, the required Python libraries such as OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib are imported to perform image processing operations.

The input image is loaded from the specified directory using Python image-handling functions and stored in a variable.

The loaded image is displayed on the screen to verify that the image has been read correctly.

The digital properties of the image, such as height, width, and number of color channels, are analyzed to understand the structure of a digital image.

The color image is converted into a grayscale image using appropriate color conversion techniques.

The grayscale image is further converted into a binary image by applying thresholding, where pixel values are classified into black and white.

Image transformation operations such as resizing are performed to change the dimensions of the image.

The image is flipped horizontally and vertically to observe geometric transformations.

A specific Region of Interest (ROI) is selected from the image by defining coordinate boundaries, and the selected portion is cropped.

Each transformed image is displayed separately to observe the effect of every operation.

Finally, the results of all operations are analyzed and verified to understand the fundamental concepts of digital image processing.

## output


==> The input image was successfully loaded and displayed on the screen.

The properties of the digital image such as resolution and color channels were observed.

The color image was converted into a grayscale image, where pixel values represent intensity levels.

The grayscale image was further converted into a binary image consisting of black and white pixels.

The image was resized to the specified dimensions and displayed correctly.

Horizontal and vertical flipping of the image was performed and verified.

A selected Region of Interest (ROI) was cropped from the original image and displayed separately.

All image processing operations produced the expected visual results, confirming correct implementation of basic image operations using Python.

## Conclusion
In this experiment, the fundamental concepts of digital images and basic image operations were successfully studied using Python. Digital images were loaded and displayed, and their structure was analyzed to understand pixel representation. Color images were converted into grayscale and binary formats to observe intensity variations. Basic image transformations such as resizing and flipping were performed effectively. Additionally, a specific Region of Interest (ROI) was cropped from the image. The results confirm that Python and OpenCV provide efficient tools for performing basic image processing operations.
